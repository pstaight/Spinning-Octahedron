# Spinning-Octahedron
This is a C language code to visualize a spinning octahedron using just ASCII characters. Follow the guide to know more aobut the working and possible modifications. 

---

### Tools and sources: 
[Symbolab](https://symbolab.com/) - to solve the matrix operations and functions.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) - to get the rotation matrices for the calculations. 

### Modifications: 
#### octWidth
  - Sets the length of one side of the octahedron 
  - Change this (along with 'horizontalOffset') to get octahedrons of different sizes 

#### backgroundASCIICode 
  - To change the background on which the octahedron spins in the terminal 
  - For aesthetics -> set as ' ' 

### Working: 
Open the terminal (in mac) or command prompt (in windows). <br/>
Go to directory in which the spinning_oct.c file is located. <br/>
Run the following commands in order: 
  - gcc spinning_oct.c
  - ls (to check if 'a.out' file is created)
  - ./a.out 
<br/>
Voila! You can see your spinning octahedron.
